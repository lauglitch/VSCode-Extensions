Auto Indent Paste is a Visual Studio Code extension that automatically adjusts indentation when pasting Python code. This helps maintain consistent formatting and improves code readability.

## Features

- Automatically adjusts indentation on selected Python code.
    * Code without empty lines between will be indented once.
    * Code with one empty line will maintain the indentation level.
    * Code with two empty lines will reset the indentation.
- Works seamlessly with different indentation levels.
- Improves code formatting and reduces manual indentation fixes.

NOTE: This behavior is subject to the code's intent and should be reviewed by the user.

## How To Use

Select the Python code you want to indent with the cursor and press 'Ctrl + Alt + I'
